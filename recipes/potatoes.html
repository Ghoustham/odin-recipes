    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are the most flavorful cripy roast potatoes you'll ever made. gluten-free and vegan.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda.</li>
        <li>4 pounds (about 2kg) the best potatoes that you have, 
            peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eights, 
            depending on size.</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin oil, duckfat, goose fat, or beef fat.</li>
        <li>small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped.</li>
        <li>3 medium cloves garlic, minced.</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>small handful fresh parsley leaves, minced.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
             Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) (or 400°F (200°C)
             <br> if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. 
             <br> Add 2 tablespoons kosher  salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until
             <br> a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds
            <br> of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, 
            <br>until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through 
            <br>a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow
            <br> excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little 
            <br> more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed
            <br> potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly.
            <br> Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal 
            <br> spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until
            <br> potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking,
            <br> 30 to 40 minutes longer.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley.
            <br> Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
        </li>
